# Risk Management Models

Welcome to the **Risk Management Models** repository! This collection contains advanced models and tools for assessing and managing financial risk. Here, you will find various techniques such as the **Delta-Normal Approximation** for Value-at-Risk (VaR), **Importance Sampling**, and **Monte Carlo Simulations**. These methods are essential for evaluating the risk exposure of portfolios under different market conditions.

## Key Features:
- **Delta-Normal Approximation for VaR**: Estimate the 5-day Value-at-Risk of portfolios, assuming a normal distribution of asset returns.
- **Importance Sampling**: Adjust probabilities to better capture rare and extreme market events, enhancing risk estimation.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Generate simulated market scenarios to assess potential losses, incorporating variance reduction techniques for efficiency.

## Getting Started

To get started with the models in this repository, follow these steps:
