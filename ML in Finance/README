SUMMARY

This project presents a comprehensive framework for portfolio optimization leveraging a
combination of machine learning, Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) simulations, and
advanced financial modeling. By integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
for return predictions and portfolio optimization techniques, the framework demonstrates a
dynamic and robust method to maximize returns while managing risk. The results are
backtested using simulated market scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.
